📝 InnovateMart Project Bedrock: Deployment & Architecture Guide
1. Project Overview & Deliverables
Git Repository Link: https://github.com/IJOBA007/innovatemart-bedrock

This project successfully deployed the retail-store-sample-app on a production-grade Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform (IaC). All Core Requirements (3.1-3.4) were met. The infrastructure was successfully verified and then destroyed to ensure fiscal responsibility.

2. Core Architecture Overview (3.1 & 3.2)
The infrastructure was provisioned using Terraform in the eu-west-1 (Ireland) region.

VPC: Created for high availability, with private subnets hosting the core infrastructure.

EKS Cluster: The Control Plane was deployed. A Managed Node Group of t3.medium instances was launched into the private subnets.

IAM Roles: Dedicated roles were provisioned (e.g., innovatemart-eks-cluster-role) following the least privilege principle.

Application: The app was deployed using in-cluster dependencies (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc., running as Pods alongside the microservices), fulfilling Core Requirement 3.2.

3. Developer Access & Instructions (3.3)
The read-only access for the development team is secured using IAM Roles for Kubernetes Access (aws-auth ConfigMap mapping).

The designated read-only user is innovatemart-dev (created via IaC) and is mapped to the Kubernetes system:viewers group.

Instructions for Read-Only Access:

Configure AWS CLI: The developer must first configure their AWS CLI profile using their unique innovatemart-dev Access and Secret keys:

Bash

aws configure
Generate Kubeconfig: Run the following command to link the IAM identity to the cluster, granting read-only permissions:

Bash

aws eks update-kubeconfig --name innovatemart-eks --region eu-west-1
Verification: The developer can run kubectl get pods (Success), but kubectl delete pod <pod-name> will return an Error: forbidden.

4. CI/CD and Automation (3.4)
The automation plan uses GitHub Actions with secure credential management via GitHub Secrets (e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID).

The terraform.yml pipeline implements the branching strategy:

Pull Requests (Feature Branches): Triggers terraform plan.

Merge to main: Triggers terraform apply --auto-approve.

5. Bonus Objectives Implementation (Extra Marks)
Advanced Networking & Security (4.2)
This objective was designed in code but not fully deployed to ensure a clean cleanup process.

Load Balancer & Ingress: The Ingress manifest was prepared with the annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "alb" to instruct the AWS Load Balancer Controller to provision an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

HTTPS/SSL: The Ingress was annotated with the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-certificate: <ACM ARN> to enable HTTPS by using an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate attached directly to the ALB.

Route 53: The process requires registering a placeholder domain (e.g., store.innovatemart.com) and creating an Alias Record to point to the ALB's DNS name.

Managed Persistence (4.1)
This objective was partially defined in IaC:

Terraform code was created to provision AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, AWS RDS for MySQL, and an Amazon DynamoDB table.

Database credentials were securely managed via AWS Secrets Manager, avoiding plaintext storage in the Git repository. Final integration would require an External Secrets Operator in EKS.
